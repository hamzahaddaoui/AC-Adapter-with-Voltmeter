# AC-Adapter-with-Voltmeter

The project's purpose was to build an AC adapter using linear components (7805 and LM317), since it is made for hobbystic purposes (low currents are drawn). 
One source of voltage is fixed at 5V and the other can be adjusted (1.2v to 14v) using a potentiometer. 

The second part of the project was building a voltmeter, sensing it using the microcontroller internal ADC (16bit) and showing it on the 7-segments display. 
The accuracy of the voltage measurement is about 0.1V.
